**NetSim** is a python package for the simulation of the evolution of a path network.

Description
===========

The **NetSim** package was design with landscape archaeologists in mind. It is very common
in landscape archaeology to group sites into simple groups. These groups might reflect coarse
temporal, functional or other differences (associated with one or combination of features of 
the sites). These groupings may translate into some form of hierarchy that will affect the 
evolution of a path network.

This package is accompanied by a series of notebooks that can be found in the ``/notebooks`` folder.
These notebooks provide examples of how to use the different functionality offered in **NetSim**

Feature
-------

**NetSim** uses a *influence weighted distance transform* or *iwdt* a purposefully designed
algorithm to enable the convergence of posterior paths onto earlier paths hence producing
path networks that tend to be more natural looking.
